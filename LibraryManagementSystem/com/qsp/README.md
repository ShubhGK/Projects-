 2) It also helps librarian to add a new book, remove the issued book, display books details by using different classes.


## WHY WE ARE CREATING THE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT USING     JAVA?
 Java is object-oriented language that has more features in it like free access and it can run on all platforms. some of the feature that make java, a best choice for such software development are Simple language, Secure, Object-Oriented,etc. 


## MVC ARCHITECTURE FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a software architecture that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. The workflow of MVC is as follows:
 
Model : Represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for data manipulation and storage.

View: Represents the user interface. It displays the data to the user and sends user input to the controller. 
 
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, interacts with the Model to update data, and then updates the View. 


For our project, By using the concept of MVC architecture, we have Created 3 Different packages named as:   

                    a) com.qsp.lms_model
                    b) com.qsp.lms_view 
                    c) com.qsp.lms_controller
