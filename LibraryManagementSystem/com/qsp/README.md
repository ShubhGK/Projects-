## MVC ARCHITECTURE FOR LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a software architecture that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. The workflow of MVC is as follows:
 
Model : Represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for data manipulation and storage.

View: Represents the user interface. It displays the data to the user and sends user input to the controller. 
 
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, interacts with the Model to update data, and then updates the View. 


For our project, By using the concept of MVC architecture, we have Created 3 Different packages named as:   

                    a) com.qsp.lms_model
                    b) com.qsp.lms_view 
                    c) com.qsp.lms_controller
